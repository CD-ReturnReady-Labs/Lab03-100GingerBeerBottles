# 100 Bottles of Ginger Bear 

You have a decided to throw a party for a group of friends who 
do not drink AL-KEY-HALL, but enjoy a nice brewed beverage. 

Once the party is over you notice that the party goers have all left
their bottles of Ginger Beer on the wall. You think there are 100 hundred bottles, but you are not sure.
So you decide to write a program that counts all the left-over bottles on the wall starting at 100, and counting down to 0.
